This repository contains a series of interpretability demos designed for the [2023 IAIFI Summer School](https://iaifi.org/phd-summer-school.html). They are provide a gentle introduction to Shapley values, feature counterfactuals, and saliency maps, and accompany [@joshspeagle](github.com/joshspeagle)'s lecture (slides are in the repo). Solutions can be found in the [solutions branch](https://github.com/alexandergagliano/InterpretabilityDemos/blob/solutions).
